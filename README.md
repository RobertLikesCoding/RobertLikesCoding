## Hi there 👋

### I'm Robert, a passionate coder and creator!

After diving headfirst into coding for over 4 months at the end of 2023, I solidified my foundation with [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com/de) intensive 6-month bootcamp. Meanwhile I dabbled in game development which is something I'd love to explore further on the side but professionally I'm invested in web development ❤️

🔭 The tools I learned to use so far are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Figma, Git, Github, SQL, Heroku, Bootstrap

🌱 I’m currently learning how to use React and NodeJS.

I'd be excited to join a dynamic team where I can contribute my skills professionally but I'm also very interested in building open-source projects so **definetly reach out if you're looking for a passionate collaborator** 👍
