## Hi there 👋

### I'm Robert, a passionate coder and creator!

I’m a passionate frontend developer who loves the blend of creativity and problem-solving and gets excited by great UI/UX design. Whether building a project from scratch or improving existing applications, I'm happy with my fingers on my keyboard. As a curious person I love learning and aquiring new skills whenever a project requires it. I learned the core programming concepts and best practices during a six-month Full Stack Web Development bootcamp which greatly increased my curiosity to further.

🔭 The tools I love working with are `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Figma`, `React`, `Ruby on Rails`, `Git`, `Github` and `Bootstrap`

🌱 I’m currently training myself to build confidently with React and become routined in writing tests.

I'd be excited to collaborate to a open-source project so **definetly reach out if you're looking for a passionate collaborator** 👍
