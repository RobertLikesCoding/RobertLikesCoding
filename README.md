## Hi there 👋

### I'm Robert, a passionate coder and creator!

After diving headfirst into coding for over 4 months at the end of 2023, I solidified my foundation with [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com/de) intensive 6-month bootcamp. I'm now adept at building and deploying fully functioning web applications and eager to put these skills into practice in a professional work environment.

🔭 The tools I learned to use so far are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Figma, Git, Github, SQL, Heroku, Bootstrap

🌱 I’m currently learning how to use React and NodeJS.

I'd be excited to join a dynamic team where I can contribute my skills, learn from experienced developers, and grow alongside the team. Let's build something awesome together! Feel free to reach out if you're looking for a passionate and quick learner!
